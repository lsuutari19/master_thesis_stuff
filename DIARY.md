Started researching Terraform and learning its basics.

General first implementatio workflow for students:

1. Student creates a VM, installs and configures it to work as a firewall
2. Student uses Terraform/alternative to create the internal network
3. Student tests different options in firewall to allow/block access to said network
4. Student uses wireshark to play around with the network

After discussing with Niklas the firewall solution should be easily deployed as well along with the internal network so students have to do as little as possible to get the platform up and running.

Figuring out a firewall solution that can be containerized, Niklas suggested QEMU/KMV solutions, dont worry about Terraforming it yet, first work it out with simple Dockerization. Problem with pfSense that Asad suggests is that it isn't really a good solution for containerization. Tried out simple-firewall, but it is deprecated and updated 7 years ago.

Network driver seems to be connected to the solution somehow:
https://docs.docker.com/network/drivers/

Perhaps creating a container with default alpine linux and changing it's iptables configuration could be a solution, but would it be real-life scenario like? This would be handled similarly to the docker-simple-firewall solution: https://github.com/0xcaff/docker-simple-firewall/tree/master

Note: changed daemon.json, iptables to false, reverted it.
